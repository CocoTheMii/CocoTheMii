### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm CocoTheMii, but you can call me Coco for short. My pronouns are he/him.

I'm most comfortable working with HTML and CSS, although I do dabble in Python from time to time.

I also like working with graphics. I'm by no means a graphic designer, but I've got experience using Paint.NET and Adobe Illustrator.

### What I'm up to

On GitHub, I mainly keep an eye on and occasionally interact with various other repositories. I don't have any real projects of my own at the moment.

This account is, at the moment, operated in tandem with my Scratch profile, which can be found [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Scratch137). If you'd like to contact me, this is a good place to do it. Most of my contributions are on projects originating from the Scratch Forums, which is also where most of my time on Scratch is spent.
